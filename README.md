Building portfolios based on the NASDAQ-100 index

The project consists in of the creation of a portfolio on the time series of the past five years of given index,
following the principles of the Capital Asset Pricing Model. The goal of the project is to understand the factors
underlying the performance of a specific portfolio. To understand this empirically, we need to construct real
portfolios that are concentrated/inclined with respect to a specific level and type of risk, in practice it will be
necessary to determine the amount of total risk that we take in investing in a specific portfolio, divided then into
specific risk and systematic risk. The index chosen was the Nasdaq100: it is a basket of the 100 largest, most
actively traded U.S companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The index includes companies from various
industries except for the financial industry, like commercial and investment banks. These non-financial sectors
include retail, biotechnology, industrial, technology, health care, and others.
